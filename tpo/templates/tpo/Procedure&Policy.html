					<li>The company should fill in the Job Notification Form (JNF) and submit it to the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) either online, as an e-mail attachment to tpo@iitbhu.ac.in, or as a hard copy. The JNF serves as an introduction of the job profile for the benefit of the candidates and also informs them of the company's requirements.</li>
					<li>The relevant content of the JNF is electronically broadcasted to all the students along with the other additional information furnished by the company.</li>
					<li>The company can ask for the resumes of interested students and has the liberty to shortlist them before the beginning of the placement process.</li>

On failing to do so, the allotted slot may be given to other companies on their request. Request for any change in the slot can be entertained subject to its availability.</li>
					<li>TPC advises the companies to conduct the PPT before the recruitment process for final placement commences. This will provide ample time to the students for making a considered decision in joining the company. Early conduct of Written/Online test may facilitate the company in earning an early slot for final placement.</li>
					<li>In case the company finds it inconvenient to visit the campus twice for going through its complete selection process, it can be accommodated to carry out the entire selection process, including PPT, during final placement season on a mutually agreed date. However, in such a situation it may not be possible to accommodate the company in the early days of the final placement season.</li>
